```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

According to the Hofstede dataset, the country with the highest individualism was `r max_country2`. The country with the highest collectivism was `r min_country2`.

### Summary of individualism values: (kable will display results better, need to run library ("knitr"))
```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(idv_summary2_df)
```

### Table of countries sorted by individualism scores
```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(idv_data_df)
```
